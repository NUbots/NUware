     * @brief This struct mimics the expected data structure for a Write command.
     *
     * @details
     *  This type has it's members arranged in the same way as a raw array of this command would. Because of this
     *  you cannot add or remove members from this type. The template argument and parameter allows you to write
     *  any type. For example if you write with a uint16_t then it will write two bytes to the device. And if you
     *  use a struct with 3 uint16_t's in it, then you directly write to something with an x, y and z byte.
     *
     * @tparam T the type of data to be written
