     * @brief This struct mimics the expected data structure for a Action command.
     *
     * @details
     *  Instruction that executes the Packet that was registered beforehand using Reg Write.
     *  This type has it's members arranged in the same way as a raw array of this command would.
     *  Because of this you cannot add or remove members from this type. The template argument and parameter allows
     * you to write any type. For example if you write with a uint16_t then it will write two bytes to the device.
     * And if you use a struct with 3 uint16_t's in it, then you directly write to something with an x, y and z
     * byte.
     *
     * @tparam T the type of data to be written
